# ✈️ Airport Operations AI Business Management & Data Analysis Project
AI-driven business management and data analysis project for airport operational difficulties, providing insights and forecasting passenger traffic, delays, and resource utilization.

## 📌 Project Overview

Airports are complex operational environments facing continuous challenges such as flight delays, passenger congestion, inefficient resource allocation, baggage handling issues, and revenue volatility. This project applies **AI, data analytics, and forecasting techniques** to analyze airport operational difficulties, generate **business management insights**, and **predict future operational risks**.

This repository represents an **AI Business Management + Data Analysis capstone project**, suitable for academic submissions, portfolios, and real-world business analytics demonstrations.
